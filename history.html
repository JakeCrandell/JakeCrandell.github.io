            <h2>History of Scorekeeping</h2>
            <img id="baseball" alt="baseball picture" src="img/baseball2.png">
            <h4>The First Box Scores</h4>
            <p style="text-indent: 1.5em">Back in the late 1850s, baseball was really gaining a lot of fans, especially in the east coast.
              One of the biggest series back then was between the All Brooklyn team and the All New York team. In this time, they just played
              the game, that was pretty much it. Then they came up with basically two statistics to keep track of: Hands Lost and Runs. Both
              these statistics were what we would consider to be an offensive statistic, or batting statistic. Hands Lost was just how many
              times you got out while Runs was how many times you scored. This was also when the first box scores were just starting to make it into
              local newspapers. The first couple statistics listed in a box score in the newspaper was one of the main ways people found out
              about this interesting sport called baseball.</p>
            <h4>Henry Chadwick</h4>
            <p style="text-indent: 1.5em">One of the interested, curious attendees of some of those early baseball games between New York and
              Brooklyn was a man named Henry Chadwick. Chadwick attended those games barely knowing anything about baseball, but he left those
              games with a new interest that would quickly become his life long passion. Chadwick started analyzing every part of the game of
              baseball. He started coming up with new ways to judge a player's skill, leading to brand new statistics never seen before. Chadwick
              had, and still has, so much meaning in the world of baseball. He later became known as "The Father of Baseball". It is just amazing
              that baseball started out with only two statistics, which were very close in nature to begin with, but then because of men like
              Henry Chadwick, we now have hundreds of possible ways to view a single game.</p>
            <h4>Scorekeeping Drives Baseball</h4>
            <p style="text-indent: 1.5em">In today's world, if you go to an afternoon baseball game, you won't see many people, if any at all, with pencil and paper
              trying to physically keep score of the game. That is because in today's stadiums there are huge scoreboards that tell you a lot
              of what you need instantaneously. Well, back when baseball was first getting popular, the only way to see how a certain player
              was playing that day was to physically keep score for yourself. This new found scorekeeping took on a lifeform of its own.
              Pretty soon everybody was bringing their pencil and paper to the stadium with them. Scorekeeping played a huge role in the
              popularity of baseball.</p>
