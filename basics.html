            <h2>Basics of Scorekeeping</h2>
            <img id="baseball" alt="baseball picture" src="img/baseball2.png">
            <h4>Lineups</h4>
            <p style="text-indent: 1.5em">The very first section you are going to fill out in your scorebook will be the lineups for both teams.
              It should look something like this:</p>
            <img alt="linuep" src="img/scoring1.gif">
              <!--Above image retrieved from http://baseballscorecard.com/scoring.htm -->
            <p style="text-indent: 1.5em">You would fill out the name, number, and position for each player in the starting lineup for each team.
              You can use either the numbers or the abbreviations to accurately mark the postions, they both work. There should be nine
              players for each team. If you are using DHs, you would also have to include the pitcher's name in the pitchers section.</p>
            <h4>At-Bats</h4>
            <p style="text-indent: 1.5em">Now that you have the lineups filled out, as the game progresses you need to fill out each at bat
              as they happen. You just draw in the lines around the diamond as players progress around the bases and you write down the
              abbreviation for how they got on base. Here is an example:</p>
            <img alt="at-bat-example" src="img/scoring5.gif">
              <!--Above image retrieved from http://baseballscorecard.com/scoring.htm -->
            <p style="text-indent: 1.5em">In this example, the batter successfully reached first base (as indicated by the drawn line) and he
             was able to reach it by drawing a walk (as indicated by the written abbreviation, BB, or base on balls).</p>
            <h4>Base Runners and Scoring Runs</h4>
            <p style="text-indent: 1.5em">As more batters come to the plate, you continue to draw lines for all the batters/runners still on the
              bases, which means you will have to go back up to the other players lines. When a runner reaches home plate and scores a run,
              you mark that by completing the diamond, but also lightly coloring in the diamond. Coloring in the diamonds makes it much easier
              to spot all the runs that have crossed home plate as you are going back through to find the final score of the game.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 1.5em">This was a very basic run through of how to score a baseball game. By just doing this basic scoring,
              it's very easy to teach younger kids who want to score, but might not understand the full scoring system. If you want to take a
              look at some more advanced scoring, click on the 'Advanced Scoring Techniques' in the navigation.</p>
